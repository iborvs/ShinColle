Shin Colle
==========
Shinkeiseikan Collection

This is a personal modification.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Based off https://github.com/Cappycot/ShinColle https://github.com/Theray070696/ShinColle

Technically working 1.12.2 version. Check bugs.txt for a more in-depth coverage of what I did to it so far and known remaining issues. -Mystia

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is an unofficial port of the 1.10.2 build to 1.12.2.
No new features will be added, and only bugs caused by the 1.12.2 port will be fixed.

Add cute ship girls for battle and decoration.


To translator (except zh_TW):
You can edit ship/item description as you like.
I finished en_US by google translate, please correct the weird translation if you found.
